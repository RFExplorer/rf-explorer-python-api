RFExplorer Python API Example
==================================

Use Case: You are arriving at a new venue on your tour and would like to have an RF survey to send back to your supporting shop to predict any issues you might have with the shop's RF coordination.

Run exampleScript.py and follow the prompts. The script will output a CSV file that you can email to the shop! This saves you time on load in by just setting up the RF Explorer on your computer and letting the script do its work.  If you have ever had to do this manually, you will understand how beneficial this is.
